# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### What is Support Vector Machine (SVM)?
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification and regression tasks. The main goal of SVM is to find the optimal boundary (hyperplane) that best separates data points from different classes.

### üîç How Does It Work?
SVM constructs a decision boundary that maximizes the margin between two classes. The data points that are closest to the boundary are called support vectors. These points are crucial in defining the position of the hyperplane.

If the data is not linearly separable, SVM can project it into a higher-dimensional space using a technique called the kernel trick, allowing for better separation.

### üß† Common Kernel Types
##### Linear: For linearly separable data.

##### Polynomial: For polynomial decision boundaries.

##### RBF (Radial Basis Function): Commonly used for complex data boundaries.

##### Sigmoid: Similar to artificial neural networks.
